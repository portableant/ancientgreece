&agoraPrison=This is the prison. If someone is found guilty at one of the law courts they would be taken here to await their sentence. In Athens they do not imprison anyone as a punishment. If someone is found guilty they usually have to pay a fine. If they have done something really awful they are sentenced to death.
This is where the philosopher Sokrates spent his last moments.  He was sentenced to death for 'neglecting the gods' and 'corrupting the young'.

&sacredAsklepieionCaption=<p align='center'>A marble head of Asklepios</p>

&asklepieionTitle=The Asklepieion

&sacredDipylon=Athens is a walled city. You need to enter the city through one of its gates. This is one of the main entrance points to Athens, the Dipylon gate. The road from here leads to the Academy, one of the city's gymnasia.

&dipylonTitle=Dipylon Gate

&wallTitle=Walls

&sacredWall=Like many other Greek cities, Athens is surrounded by walls. This is for protection in times of war. The walls of the city are made with bits of old buildings and rubble. This is because the Athenians wanted to rebuild the walls as quickly as possible after the Persians nearly destroyed the city. They had no materials though and very little money. So they used any materials they could get their hands on to build them.

&kerameikosGeneral=This area, north-west of the Agora, is called the Kerameikos. It contains the potters' quarter, one of the main gates into the city and beyond the city walls, the cemetery.

&tradeshipTitle=Kantharos

&warshiptitle=Zea

&piraeusGeneral=This is Piraeus. This is a harbour town that is connected to the city of Athens by two long walls. It's very important to the life of Athens.

&piraeusExplore=Explore some of the goods that were shipped into and out of Piraeus.

&import1=Nearly all of Attica's woodland had been destroyed by the 5th century BC. Athens had to rely on imported timber from Macedonia, Thrace and Southern Italy.

&import1title=Timber

&import2=The countryside around Athens could not produce enough grain to feed the people of Athens. The city relied on imported grain from countries such as Egypt, Thrace, Sicily and the lands around the Black Sea.

&import2title=Burnt grain from a Greek pot

&import3=Cloth in Greece was mostly made from wool or linen. Linen was made from imported flax from Egypt. Cotton was known but not very common. From the 5th century BC onwards, silk was starting to appear in Athens.

&import3title=A fragment of linen cloth

&import4=Amber was highly valued in the ancient Greek world. The known sources of amber in the ancient world were in Denmark and the Baltics. From here it was transported across Europe to the Black Sea, and then it was shipped to Athens.

&import4title=An amber bead

&import5=Tin was exported from modern day France. The Greek colony town of Massalia became a major centre in the trade of tin. Tin was used to make bronze which was important for weapons and tools.

&import5title=Tin

&import6=The slave trade was a thriving business at this time. Many slaves were captives or prisoners from wars and battles. Thrace and the countries around the Black Sea exported a great number of slaves.

&import6title=A pot fragment showing a Thracian slave, employed as a nurse

&import7=Grapes were grown in the Attic countryside.  There was certainly no shortage of wine in Athens. However, wine from Thasos and Chios was believed to be much better than the local variety. A great amount of wine was also imported from Rhodes and Knidos. This wine was not as highly prized, but it was very cheap!

&import7title=An amphora for transporting wine

&export1=Laurion, in the south of Attica, was a huge industrial area. The mines were state owned. The silver that was mined here was of great importance to Athens. It provided the money for the creation of the Athenian navy and some of the money for the rebuilding of the Acropolis.

&export1title=A silver ingot

&export2=Finely painted pottery was a popular export to many places around the Greek world. Athenian pottery was the most popular of all Greek pottery. 

&export2title=A cup, or skyphos, made in Athens

&export3=Olive oil was another of Athens' exports. It was used for many things in ancient Greece: on food, to rub on the skin, for medicine and to use in lamps. Olive oil was highly prized and expensive. The winner at the Panathenaic Games would receive large amphorae filled with oil as their prize.

&export3title=This amphora would have contained olive oil. It was a winner’s prize at the Panathenaic Games.

&sacredKerameikos=This smoky and dirty part of town is the Kerameikos, the potter's quarter. The smoke comes from the kilns of the many workshops here. Athenian pottery has a very good reputation. It is exported to many places around the Mediterranean.

&sacredCemetery=Many of the roads leading away from Athens are lined with the tombs of the dead.  The cemetery just outside the Dipylon gate houses the tombs of some of Athens' most famous citizens like Perikles. 

&cemetaryExplore=Explore these objects from an ancient Greek cemetery.

&cemeteryTitle=Cemetery

&cemetaryGravestone=Athenian gravestones often showed a picture of the person who had died. Many give clues to the person's occupation. For example the figure in this gravestone holds a last, a model that shoemakers use for repairing or making shoes. 
The two smaller figures probably represent his daughters. It was very common to have the dead person's family also represented on their gravestone.

&cemetaryWoman=This is a figure of a mourning woman. It comes from the island of Rhodes and dates to around 650BC. She holds her hands to her head in her anguish. Her chest is covered with cuts. She has probably cut herself in her anguish.

&cemetaryGravestone2=This gravestone shows a seated woman attended by a nurse holding a baby. It may be that this woman died in childbirth.

&cemetaryLekythos=This is a lekythos, a flask for holding perfumed oil. It would probably have been left in a tomb as a funeral offering. This lekythos shows a funeral scene. A woman with her hair cut short to show mourning leans over a dead youth laid out on a bier. A bier is a frame that was used to carry the dead to the grave. The dead were wrapped in waxed cloth. A coin was placed in the mouth. This was to pay Charon, the ferryman who would take the dead over the River Styx to the underworld.

&cemetaryGravetoys=This group of terracotta objects is from a young girl's grave. They may have been toys that the girl played with during her life. The doll has an epinetron (a thigh guard used when preparing wool for spinning), a pair of boots and a bowl that was used at marriage ceremonies.

Attica is very hot in the summer and has much less rainfall than the rest of Greece. So the people of Athens still have to import some types of food.
